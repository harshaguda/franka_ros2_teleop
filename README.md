# Force-Sensitive Teleoperation of Franka Robots in ROS 2

**franka_ros2_teleop** is a ROS 2 package that demonstrates the teleoperation of a **Franka FR3** robot with another **Franka FR3** robot as input device.
Due to the robot's force-torque sensors we can send contact forces measured by the follower to the leader robot.
The leader robot will then replay the forces so the teleoperator can feel the contacts as well.

## Bilateral control architecture (4-channel)

The teleoperation controllers implement a **4-channel bilateral control** scheme: position and
force are each transmitted explicitly, in both directions, and each direction has its own
independently tunable gain. This decouples *tracking* from *feel*, so one gain no longer has to
compromise between the two:

| # | Channel | Direction | Signal | Gain(s) | Tunes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Position coupling | leader → follower | leader's measured joint position/velocity | `k_gains` / `d_gains` (follower) | Tracking accuracy: how tightly the follower's motion follows the leader |
| 2 | Force reflection | follower → leader | follower's sensed external (contact) torque | `force_reflection_gains` (leader) | Feel: how strongly the operator perceives the follower's contact forces |
| 3 | Force feedforward | leader → follower | leader's own sensed external (operator-applied) torque | `force_feedforward_gains` (follower) | Feel: how directly the operator's applied force acts on the follower, without needing to raise the position gains |

Channel 1 alone would make `k_gains`/`d_gains` the single knob governing both how well the
follower tracks the leader *and*, indirectly, how "stiff" or "soft" the follower feels when it
contacts the environment. Adding channels 2 and 3 as explicit, separately-gained torque terms means
`k_gains`/`d_gains` can be tuned purely for tracking, while `force_reflection_gains` and
`force_feedforward_gains` can be tuned purely for feel.

Both force channels reuse the same `franka_robot_state_broadcaster/external_joint_torques` topic
that each robot (leader and follower) already publishes: the leader controller subscribes to the
follower's external torques (channel 2), and the follower controller subscribes to the leader's own
external torques (channel 3). Setting a `force_*_gains` parameter to all zeros disables that
channel.

To run the teleoperation, you need to have at least two **Franka FR3** robots with the **FCI (Franka Control Interface)** feature.
One will be the leader and the other will be the follower.
The leader can be handguided and the follower will match the leaders position.
The forces encountered by the follower can be felt by the person hand-guiding the leader.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Avoid hand-guiding the follower, as it might lead to abrupt movements of the leader!

## Getting started

To run any quickstart example, you must add the correct IP addresses of you robot to the configuration as described in the following subsections. All other parameters have sensible defaults. If you need to change them, they are datailed in the section [Configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters).

You can also find minimal config examples in the config folder: [config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml](config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml) for single arm setups and [config/fr3_duo_teleop_config.yaml](config/fr3_duo_teleop_config.yaml) for custom humanoid setups, **FR3 Duo** or **Mobile FR3 Duo**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting, make sure you can reach your robots over the local network and they are in **FCI** Mode.

### Docker-based Quickstart

The Docker-based quickstart Methods get you started fast and you do not need to worry about depencies like ROS 2.
To run any of them, you must modify the configuration in the `x-teleop-config` section of the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

#### Using pre-built Docker image

Download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file and open it in an editor. Add the IP addresses of your robots and run `docker compose up` in the directory containing the modified `docker-compose.yml`. This will download and run a pre-built image from GitHub and run it.

#### Using locally built Docker container

Clone the repo, then open the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file in an editor and add the IP addresses of your robots.
Then run `docker compose up --build` in the top-level directory of the repo. This will build a docker image locally and run it.

### ROS 2 Quickstart

If you are familiar with ROS 2 and want to get more into the code, we recommend using any of the following methods.

To add the IP addresses of your robots to the configuration, you will need to edit the file [config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml](config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml) after downloading the repo.
After building and sourcing your workspace (for more detailed instructions see below), you can run the teleoperation example using: `ros2 launch franka_ros2_teleop teleop.launch.py`.

Alternativley, you can also create a copy of either config file and supply that file to the launch command: `ros2 launch franka_ros2_teleop teleop.launch.py robot_config_file:=/path/to/your/copy/of/fr3_teleop_config.yaml`


#### Using a Dev Container in VS Code

Clone the repo, open the folder in VS Code and reopen the folder as container. 

Now modify the config files as described above.

In a terminal, build the ROS 2 workspace by navigating to `/home/franka/ros2ws/` and executing `colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
After building the workspace, source it using: `source install/setup.bash`

You can now launch the teleoperation.

#### Integrate it into your own ROS 2 workspace

This repo is a standard ROS 2 package. You can download it into your `src` folder as usual. You might need to also download the [franka_ros2](https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2) dependency manually.

To set up a ROS 2 environment, follow the official ROS 2 Humble installation [instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

After creating a [workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), download the repo to the `src` directory and modify the config files as described above.

In a terminal, build the ROS 2 workspace by navigating to `/path/to/your/ros2_workspace/` and executing `colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

After building the workspace, source it using: `source install/setup.bash`

You can now launch the teleoperation.

## Configuration parameters

In this section the parameters of interest to the user are listed and explained here. You can set them in a config file (example: [config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml](config/fr3_teleop_config.yaml)) or in the `x-teleop-config` parameter of the `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
# Base parameters:
# These parameters are valid for all started robots
# Except when they overridden by pair or robot-specific parameters.
# If not set there are defaults for most of them.
# Example values shown here are the default values

urdf_file: "fr3/fr3.urdf.xacro" # Which robot model to use.
# Must match your actual robots.
# Possible values are: fr3/fr3.urdf.xacro, fr3v2/fr3v2.urdf or xacro or fp3/fp3.urdf.xacro

load_gripper: false # If 'true' launch additional nodes to allow teleoperation of the Franka Hand.
# Franka Hands must be attached to the robots if set to 'true'.
# If you have a third-party gripper or hand attached you must set this to `false`.

input_topic_timeout: 2500000 # If messages received from other robots are too old the robot goes into zero gravity mode

fake_hardware: false # For testing purposes you can use fake hardware interfaces

base_namespace: null # Which base namespace to use. All nodes will be started in the base namespace

# Force channels of the 4-channel bilateral control scheme (see "Bilateral control architecture"
# above). Independent from k_gains/d_gains, so tracking and feel can each be tuned on their own.
force_reflection_gains: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] # Leader-side gain on the follower's contact torque reflected back to the operator (feel).

alpha: [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1] # Feedback-avoidance damping on the leader, per joint. Prevents the leader from "jumping away" right after the follower makes contact.

pairs:
    - namespace: pair_one # each pair must have the 'namespace' parameter set

      leader:
        robot_ip: leader.pair_three.franka.de
      follower:
        robot_ip: follower.pair_three.franka.de
